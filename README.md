File Description:

- link_prediction.ipynb : This is the main notebook for link prediction challange.
- feature_selection.ipynb : This is where we run our feature selection methods, we iterate over 100 times with random sampling of the 19 features we come up with. We select the best features that give us a good balance between TPR and TNR
- pagerank_creation.ipynb : This notebook creates the rooted pagerank for every node pair and saves it in a json file. We call this json file when we are computing pagerank in our feature extractor.
- utils/dataprep.py : This file is the utility where all the functions we use are located.
- data : This folder contains the data from competition, rooted page rank json, our best submission file.
